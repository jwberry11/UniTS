<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
  The rise of foundational models in the sphere of generative artificial intelligence have already had a massive impact on deep learning. Foundational models are models that are trained on a broad array of 
  data and are capable of performing various tasks The most notable examples are large language models as they were the first to arise, initially in the area of natural language processing. Starting off being capable of only text-to-text tasks,
  foundational models have since developed the ability to perform tasks such as image generation, code completion,  and visual comprehension among many others. 
  However, one area in which there hasn’t been a development of a unified, foundational model is time series forecasting. Time series forecasting tasks can be broken down into several categories.
  <ul>
    <li> Long-Term Forecasting - Prediction based on a lookback window, long-term refers to a time horizon that generally extends more than one year and can range up to years or decades</li>   
    <li> Short-Term Forecasting - Prediction based on a lookback window, short-term refers to a time horizon that generally extends to the next few days months, or in some cases next few minutes, hours, or days</li>
    <li> Imputation - Filling in missing data based on the structure of the time series</li>
    <li> Classification - Categorizing time series data into predefined groups based on temporal features</li>
    <li> Anomaly Detection - The identification of unusual patterns or events that deviate from the expected behavior of a time series</li>
  </ul>
  A number of state of the art models exist for the various tasks, with some of the best performers being TimesNet, TimeMixer, and iTransformer. 
  But until now, there hasn’t been a foundational model for time series data. This is due to a few challenges that are unique to time series data. One is that characteristics of time series data vary widely over different domains.
  Since time series models learn based on temporal dynamics, being able to capture common dynamics that apply to unseen all time series is key in developing a unified model. Another is that different tasks in time series analysis
  have fundamentally different goals such as regression or classification in typical machine learning. A foundational model must be able to adapt to a range of tasks without compromising performance.
  The researchers of the UniTS paper were able to build a unified time series model capable of generalizing over multiple domains and tasks. We believe that this development can have huge implications for the future of time series analysis in practice.
  In our research we seek to test the capabilities of the UniTS model over multiple tasks with a new dataset. Being able to use one model with the same weights for multiple tasks can be cost and time effective across a variety of domains. 
  </p>

<h2>2. Literature Review</h2>

<p>
  Gao et al. developed the UniTS model to handle multiple time series tasks with shared weights. Their generalized model outperforms task-tuned baseline models 27 of 38 times. 
  The tasks consisted of forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and classification, all of which can be performed by the same model without requiring any additional task-specific modules. 
  The UniTS model consists of a token based approach inspired by LLMs. The model introduces three tokens: sequence tokens, prompt tokens, and task tokens. 
  The time series input is encoded into the sequence tokens, the prompt tokens carry important information about the task and domain, and the task tokens are concatenated to the sequence and 
  prompt tokens to be transformed into the output prediction later. Their results are indicative of a model capable of zero-shot, few-shot, and prompt-based learning across many domains. 
  We want to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the novel Unified Time Series model proposed by evaluating it on different human activity monitoring tasks. The researchers documented their 
  averaged results across several datasets and tasks, but it is unclear how the model will perform individually on each task for a novel human activity dataset.
